Collecting contributions for techncial feedback review

Hi there! 

Thanks for your patience in receiving this message. As you can imagine, there's been a lot of interest in our projects, so we just want to make sure we give you the best opportunity to contribute meaningfully to our project. So let's not wait any longer! Let's get started. 

The purpose of this project over the summer is to undertake an assessment of how HOT current collects, handles and actions user feedback. This may be during business as usual or during User Testing periods. 

For the contribution phase, we are looking to better understand our product users and stakeholders in an effort to understand how satisfied they are with our current feedback mechanisms and how we may improve them. 

To complete this contribution you should complete the following steps. 

1. Pick one group from the list of stakeholders > partner, HOT internal staff, contributor, OSM community member, 
2. Have a call with at least TWO people from your user group to understand how they give feedback, if they are satisfied with it and what ideas or feedback they may have on the process (you can choose the specific interview questions, but these are the interview objectives)
3. Summarise your notes to best reflect the interview objectives. 
4. Criticalky think about what the user needs are, their levels of satisfaction and their insights
5. Create a list of reccoemdations of how we may improve our current process. You can propose workflow reccoemdations or specific tools, up to you. 
6. Submit your interview notes, summary and reccoemdations to the following repo: https://github.com/hotosm/tech-feedback-review 
7. Your work will be used for the internship this summer to enhance or develop a system to improve HOTs technical feedback process. So remember, the work that you out into this will make the interns experience much deeper (and that intern could be you! )

Valuable skills
- initiative
- problem solving and discovering solutions 
- finding answers, not just asking for them 
- collaboration
- community engagement
- community voice
- creative thinking 
- working with others effectively remotely/online


Some HOT tips:
- each of the potential interns may be working on similar things. As such, we want to avoid duplication, so collaboration may need to play a role. 
- There's no problems with people working together. If you find another potential intern working on a similar thing, go ahead make a new friend and work together :) 
- in all open communities listening to and accurately representing the community is critical. So keep this in mind. It should be an echo of the community's voice. Not just one person's opinion. 
- there are not a lot of additional 'rules' here. This is an exercise exploration and creativity. So we want you to be in control of the process. Take it where you believe it should go :) 
- if you are having troubles pinning down busy people's time, you can also read some of the OSM diaries and HOT blogs that may help fill time while you're waiting for people to respond. 
- some people are busy. So please take the time to understand how and when they'd like to be contacted. Keep in mind people are often on different timezones. No one enjoys a 3am workmessage on a Saturday night.  

So where to start?
- Do you have an OSM account? You should :)
- do you have a GitHub account? You should >
- do you have HCD experience? If not start here >> ideo link 
- the rest is up to you. 

Feel free to ask any clarifying questions, but keep in mind that initiative is something with high value in remote work, so we're here to support your process
