# Project Brief

This research is aimed at understanding how the Humanitarian OpenStreet Map organization collects, handles and implements users' feedback and provides support to its community and users. The Human-Centered Design research methodology was used during this research to understand the people we are designing for and end up with a new or improved solution that is tailored to suit their needs.

# Frame of Inquiry

To carry out this research, I came up with questions that I would ask the research participants. In order to ensure that I asked open-ended questions, the said questions were eventually tailored to fit the mood of each participant I had a conversation with.

### Find the questions below:

1.  Which of the following roles describes what you do in the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Community? - Partner, HOT internal staff, Contributor or OSM community member.

2.  When did you join the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap community? 

3.  Have you ever submitted or given the maintainers of the organization feedback on any issue, problems or ideas you may have had? 

4.  If yes, what was the feedback? 

5.  What was the response time to your feedback?

6.  Was it eventually implemented or resolved? 

7.  Do you like HOTs current feedback process? 

8.  Do you think the way the HOT community handles feedback is effective? For example, is it easy for new users/contributors to find answers to questions that have already been asked by someone else especially on platforms like Slack where people send a lot of messages?

9.  Do you think the process should change or improve? 

10. Do you have any suggestions on the best tools to enable the HOT community to receive and implement feedback quickly? 

11. Do you think HOT's feedback process is an important topic to raise and talk about?

12. Would you love me to reach out to you if I have more questions around this?

# Research Participants

Finding research participants who met my criteria for the research was quite tricky because very few people in the HOT write a brief description of their role in the community on their Slack Profile. This led me to send this [message](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qIy-EpKmB--0ASqCDTjNz9eYRZG5qEyUwne7Qay9ysU/edit?usp=sharing) to 13 people randomly because I realized that I had to have a conversation with the proposed participants first before figuring out what kind of stakeholders they were. Interestingly, out of the 13 people I sent the [message](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qIy-EpKmB--0ASqCDTjNz9eYRZG5qEyUwne7Qay9ysU/edit?usp=sharing) to, only 7 people have responded to my message at the time of this writing. Out of the 7 people that responded, two indicated that their schedule was too tight to become participants in the research while the other 5 accepted to participate in the research.

I have been able to interview 4 out of the 5 people who agreed to participate in the research. I interviewed two HOT Internal Staff and OSM Community Members respectively. After the interviews were concluded, I decided to focus the research on the OSM Community Members from the list of  stakeholders shared by Bo because these set of people were mostly affected by either the good or bad side of HOT's feedback and technical support while the HOT internal staff was on the receiving end.

# Research Logistics

I used a platform called Calendly, Google Hangouts and Slack to conduct this research. With Calendly, I created a timeslot of different days and shared it with the proposed research participants then used Slack to have a conversation with participants who were not chanced to join a call through Google Hangouts.

# The Research

The participants of this research are not anonymous. They can be classified as OpenStreet Map Community Members. Both participants have been part of the Humanitarian OpenStreet Map community for over 6 to 8 years. The first participant has been in the community for 8 years while the second participant has been in the community for 4 years. With this amount of experience in the community, it is safe to say that the participants of this research are well knowledgeable about the HOT community and if we end up with a new or improved solution that is tailored to suit their needs, it would also suit the needs of other members of the community.

The participants were asked open-ended questions that allowed them to answer in their own unique way. Find the synthesis and analysis of the research below.

# Synthesis

Keeping in mind that the goal was to understand how HOT collects, implements, and provides technical support for its users, community, and contributors. This synthesis of this research is broken down into three sections.

### What did participants think of HOT's process of collecting feedback?

**What they liked:**  Participants explained that they liked how feedback was collected by the HOT community. The methods of collecting data they've seen include but are not limited to Github, Slack, Emails and during After Action Report (AAR). 

**What they didn't like:** No participant explicitly said they disliked HOT's means of collecting feedback.

### What did participants think of HOT's process of implementing feedback and providing Technical Support?

**What they liked:** Participants were impressed at the way the HOT community implemented the feedback they received especially on Slack. According to one of the participants; "the response time on Slack is really fast while Github issues take a day or two". While another participant said "I got an immediate response when I gave my feedback on Slack"

**What they didn't like:** Participants mentioned that after feedback had been implemented, it was hard to keep track of those implementations or responses to questions for reference purposes and in case the issue occurred again or was experienced by someone else because the HOT community's most active way of sending and receiving feedback is on Slack and some important messages get lost in the pool of messages. The next active way of receiving feedback and providing technical support  Github still doesn't fix this issue because issues on Github are raised to solve a particular problem and are closed after it has been resolved.

Using the words of one of the participants, It is very strenuous to find answers to previous issues that were solved especially on Slack because a lot of messages are sent on the platform almost every minute and most times people don't even know that problem was addressed or answered. It's even harder for new users to find answers, or know where to post questions. Another participant used After Action Report (AAR) as an example, stating that there is no general storage for all AAR and he is sure he won't be able to find the After Action Report for last year.

# Recommendation

From the research conducted, OSM community members are fairly satisfied with HOT's feedback process and technical support but agree that some improvements should be made to improve the process and make it even more seamless. 

I have listed out a couple of recommendations that could improve HOT Tech feedback and technical support if they were implemented.

## Slackbot

To fix the issue of important messages getting lost in a pool of messages in Slack, I recommend that a slackbot be created to extract important messages to a different location (page, portal). 

**See an instance of the workflow below:**
Edidiong sees an important message on Slack that she feels other members of the community will benefit from in future and she types this message on the channel  - @HOTbot move this message to (page_name).

## A Q&A Webpage

It is harder for new contributors to know where to post questions so I recommend that HOT develops a Q/A webpage within the Tasking Manager for example so people can easily go in, ask questions and get answers from the community. [Geonet](https://community.esri.com/docs/DOC-13627-questions-answers)'s Q&A page  by ESRI is an effective example of a Q&A page.

## A FAQ Section 

It's even harder for new users to find answers to previously asked questions so creating a FAQ section with past frequently experienced issues and solutions. Including an option for users to report an issue here would also be a plus.

## Bio

When I conducted this research it wasn't easy to know who was part of a specific stakeholder group because it wasn't included on anybody's BIO. Asking everyone to update their BIO with their role in the HOT community would help people know the right person to reach out to when they have any issues and also easily know who can provide technical support to them. To implement this, old members can be informed via Slack or email while any new person that joins the community will be informed about this via Slack's Greetbot.

## Research

I still believe carrying out more research on this is necessary to get more information on the subject matter especially from people who have just joined the community. Chances are older members of HOT already know their way around the community. It would be great to get a fresh perspective on this.
