HOT Tech: Feedback and Technical Support Proposal

Project Description: As HOT’s products strengthen and users increase on a daily basis, HOT needs to ensure that technical support requests and feedback are gathered from all users within the HOT community in a way that is standardized across all it’s products. Building upon current practices, HOT is looking for an individual that can strengthen current Technical Support and Feedback systems and integrate open source standard practices to reduce workload and capacity of the HOT tech development team. The outcome should be conducive to supporting both the HOT community and the HOT tech team.

Some key skills/aspects of the project include:
•	Understanding business needs for HOT Technology users and HOT tech team
•	Understand workflows for HOT Tech team and ensure feedback is inline with team requests.
•	Understand community needs
•	Propose/Develop a system that integrates business requirements and the needs of the HOT tech team, HOT internal and HOT community.

## Reserched was conducted by sendinq a short survey with open questions to random HOT community memebers

Questions:

1.How long are you a member of HOT community?
2.Have you ever had any question which you would have to look it up?
3.If yes, Was it easy to find what you were looking for?
4.How can we make HOT community  better?
5.Do you have any request or feedback for HOT?
6.What would have made your experience with us better?
7.Would you be OK regularly contacting by HOT community for feedback providing?( we want to be sure that all community members needs and request met)
8.What do you like most about HOT?
9.Is there anything else you would like us to know about your experience?

##Reserach feedback from participants:

HOT memebrs were very happy to answer the questions and provide own feedback. As uo can see the new users do not have any inquiries yet and very positive with their and community work. However, memebrs with more years of experince have some feedback provided and more or less it is similiar: no contact details of responsible people for certain topics, difficulties to find.

## Feedback system:

Feedback system is just one part of the whole customer experience, which is a users/members overall perception of company/community, based on their interactions with this system. Comparatively, it refers to specific touchpoints within the experience where a member requests and receives assistance or help—for example,getting quick respond to a problem, finding the right solution. 

In short, good feedback system can be achieved if you:
•	Make listening to members a top priority across the business - regular Surveys
•	Use their feedback to develop an in-depth understanding of them 
•	Implement a system to help you collect feedback, analyze it, and act on it regularly - below examples
•	Reduce friction and solve your memebrs' specific problems and unique challenges - optimize feedback system

A good feedback system comes from asking your members questions, listening to their responses, and actioning their feedback.

## Communication Tools can be used such as:

Live Chat

One great approach to enabling direct feedback from your customers is through live chat. Intercom is a “way for internet businesses to communicate with customers, personally, at scale” which incorporates a chat widget on your website, allowing your customers to engage with you directly. Intercom is more than just a live chat though, it also offers rich metric reporting and integrations with your other favorite tools like GitHub, Slack, Salesforce, and more.

FAQ

Instead of one-on-one interactions, a FAQ/forum platforms is another option for aggregating conversations and feedback. Platform such as Tenderapp can enable your members or community to help themselves and each other, while still allowing you to monitor the discussion and gain insight. Help members help themselves: quickly answer frequently asked questions (can be done through reserach and surveys).

Introduction email/pm/dm

To make smooth transition for new comers (especially non tech people), it is advised to create an introduction email/message/pop up window which you must see how community/forum/slack/search/GIT works and who is responsible on what topics, in order to avoid similar questions, and search for help.

## Gathering Feedback is welcome in HOT community. Participants were glad to be heard, they have feedback but nobody ask them. As this community is a part of their life now, they want to contribute but in return they want to have a smooth process of doing that, which aslo on the other hand will help a HOT tech support with decreasing its workload - easy to find the right person who can help and Tech supprt team can be notified with bug or tech issues through catchword ( as in GitHub mention below).

# Surveys (Open Source tools are below):

They’re easy to set up, easy to send out, easy to analyze, and scale very well. 
Keep it short, ask only the questions that you’ll use, start with open-ended questions, 
Short Surveys on HOT Site can be another option (not more than 2 -3 questions), pick the page where it can be placed 

# Feedback/Suggest boxes and Feedback button, Talk to us (easy can be implemented by developers)

At the bottom of every page on website, you’ll find this box/button.
The entire purpose of this form is to make it really easy for HOT users to tell the developers team when something isn’t working. It’s available as soon as someone needs it, out of the way when they don’t, and sends their message to multiple people here. It even collects information like the account name, the URL, and browser version so developers’ team can recreate the problem and determine exactly how to fix it.
The whole point of a feedback box is to get feedback from users about small things. That means they have very little motivation to tell us about it in the first place. And you won’t hear about the issue through other channels since it’s only a minor annoyance.

# GitHub Issues:

GitHub Issues are a powerful and very approachable tool for just about any member on your team. A repository can be created solely for tracking feedback, requests, or comments. This functionality provides users with a straightforward way to @mention team members and issues can be intuitively labelled or assigned appropriately.

# Google Analytics or other Open Source tools:

By using an analytics package on your website you can learn how people are discovering your content, using your site, and where they’re located, along with thousands of other metrics you can combine and visualize.

Piwik
It does most of what Google Analytics does, and chances are it packs the features that you need.
Those features include metrics on the number of visitors hitting your site, data on where they come from (both on the web and geographically), from what pages they leave your site, and the ability to track search engine referrals. Piwik also has a number of reports and you can customize the dashboard to view the metrics that you want to see.
To make your life easier, Piwik integrates with over 65 content management, ecommerce, and online forum systems like WordPress, Magneto, Joomla!, and vBulletin using plugins. With anything else, you just need to add a tracking code to a page on your site.A number of web hosting firms offer Piwik as part of their one-click install packages. You can test drive Piwik or use a hosted version.

Open Web Analytics
If there’s a close second to Piwik in the open source web analytics stakes, it’s Open Web Analytics. In fact, it has a number of key features that either rival Google Analytics or leave it in the dust.
In addition to the usual raft of analytics and reporting functions, Open Web Analytics tracks where on a page and what elements on a page visitors click, provides heat maps that show where on a page visitors interact the most, and even does ecommerce tracking.
Open Web Analytics has a WordPress plugin and can integrate with MediaWiki using a plugin. Or you can add a snippet of Javascript or PHP code to your web pages to enable tracking.

eAnalytics
It shares a number of features with Piwik and Open Web Analytics, including a comprehensive reporting system, a dashboard that you can easily customize, and the ability to track metrics and statistics in real time.
This tool also lets you track one or more Twitter and Google AdWords accounts, as well as track metrics across more than one domain or server. You can also add a button or link that lets visitors opt out of being tracked. It’s a nice touch, and one that people concerned with privacy will appreciate.

# Fabric / Crashlytics:

Crashlytics is a mobile SDK in the Fabric suite of development tools (a subsidiary of Twitter). Crashlytics gives developers precise information regarding issues that are causing their apps to under perform or crash. The feedback provided by tools like these can speed up feedback cycles for developers to get ahead of bugs, potentially even before the user has an opportunity to communicate the problem. While the aforementioned Firebase also has a Crash Reporting tool, it is currently in beta release.

## Proposal that integrates business requirements and the needs of the HOT tech team, HOT internal and HOT community:

      First and foremost, you need to respond:

•	For bugs and tech issues, connect them directly to HOT tech – creating a catchword to help people easily find the right help. Ask for a more detailed description of what they were trying to accomplish (this will help HOT tech team build the right solution)
•	Use any communication tools and Open Source surveys: 

1. Lime surveys

Cost to upgrade:
LimeSurvey’s Pro version costs $24/month for Basic, $285/annually for Expert, and $985/annually for Enterprise. Software users who have downloaded LimeSurvey CE can enhance their edition of the software with Surveyor Premium.

Who uses this software:
Market research institutions, non- and for-profit organizations, students and universities, governments and other political bodies.

LimeSurvey is an open source download, meaning it offers several benefits over a free/freemium software option. While some tools charge a fee for phone or email support, LimeSurvey has a whole network of developers and users who can help you out, as well as an in-depth manual to help you work through any hiccups.

The collaborative nature of this open source system means you can ask your survey in over 80 languages. You can have unlimited administrators, but only 25 responses per month across your surveys.

From their example surveys, it’s clear that LimeSurvey is a no-fuss option that offers add-ons allowing additional templates and question types. If you have the coding know-how or an IT team to work on encountered issues, LimeSurvey puts most of the functionality of a paid tool within reach. LimeSurvey also lets you customize your surveys with your own JavaScript, photos, and videos, and even by editing your survey's HTML directly. And all that is only scratching the surface of its features.

2. Typeform

Cost to upgrade:
$350 for Pro, $700 for Pro+ (both billed annually)

Who uses this software:
Freelancers, design enthusiasts, NGOs, large enterprises, market research companies, and bloggers.

Typeform lets you create surveys using conversational data collection methods evocative of a real-life interviewer. Typeform will feed your survey-taker a question and, based on their response, feed them one of several follow-up questions that ensure a natural progression, avoiding the “just check the next box” feeling that accompanies so many surveys.

Typeform has a simple user interface that offers drag-and-drop creation and provides options ranging from customizable start screens to room for your legal disclaimers.

The basic package for this software includes ten questions per typeform, basic question types, and integration with Google Sheets and HubSpot.

3. JD Esurvey

If LimeSurvey doesn't pack enough features for you and Java-powered web applications are your thing, then give JD Esurvey a look. It's described as "an open source enterprise survey web application." It's definitely powerful, and ticks a number of boxes for organizations looking for a high-volume, robust survey tool.

Using JD Esurvey, you can collect a range of information including answers to "Yes/No" questions and star ratings for products and services. You can even process answers to questions with multiple parts. JD Esurvey supports creating and managing surveys with tablets and smartphones, and your published surveys are mobile friendly too. According to the developer, the application is usable by people with disabilities.

To give it a go, you can either fork JD Esurvey on GitHub or download and install a pre-compiled version of the application.

4. Quick Survey

For many of us, tools like LimeSurvey and JD Esurvey are overkill. We just want a quick and dirty way to gather opinions or feedback. That's where Quick Survey comes in.

Quick Survey only lets you create question-and-answer or multiple choice list surveys. You add your questions or create your list, then publish it and share the URL. You can add as many items to your survey as you need to, and the responses appear on Quick Survey's admin page. You can download the results of your surveys as a CSV file, too.

While you can download the code for Quick Survey from GitHub, it's currently optimized for Sandstorm.io and Sandstorm Oasis where you can grab it from the Sandstorm App Market.

5. TellForm

In terms of features, TellForm lies somewhere between LimeSurvey and Quick Survey. It's one of those tools for people who need more than a minimal set of functions, but who don't need everything and the kitchen sink.

In addition to having 11 different types of surveys, TellForm has pretty good analytics attached to its surveys. You can easily customize the look and feel of your surveys, and the application's interface is simple and clean.

If you want to host TellForm yourself, you can grab the code from the GitHub repository. Or, you can sign up for a free hosted account.

Second, you need to delegate people in order to reduce workload of Support team and collabartion of team itself:

•	Appoint local people to mentor remote mappers – voluntarily/voting
•	Provide email or chat name on OSM websites of users(members) who can be contacted with questions for their region
(Ex: somebody is editing in Uganda, but does not know anybody who lives there, AND they can find a contact person quickly)
•     Improving workloads by using any tool which gives you the ability to share your boards with a team, allowing group collaboration and keeping everyone on the same page, such as:
1.MyCollab is a multi-purpose solution which features tools for customer relationship management, document management, and project management. It includes many features, like a Gantt chart and milestones, time tracking, and issue management. It also supports agile development models with its Kanban board. MyCollab-Project comes in three editions, of which the community edition is the free and open source option.MyCollab is licensed under AGPLv3, requires a Java runtime and MySQL stack, and the source code is available on GitHub.
2.Taiga is an open source project management platform for startups, agile developers, and designers. It focuses on agile development methods, and has all of the required features such as a backlog, Kanban board, tasks, sprints, and issues.
Notable pros are the integration with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, making it an interesting project management tool for developers. Taiga can also be extended through plugins, and has a REST API.
3.Tuleap - With a focus on software development projects, Tuleap provides a feature rich platform which includes project management features like Scrum and Kanban support, tracking, document management, and other collaborative tools.
Pros for Tuleap are support for agile, traditional, hybrid, or custom processes for project management. It supports planning, sprints, tasks, reports, and more. This tool is very suitable for open source development companies, as the tool also integrates with Git, SVN, Jenkins, and more.
4.Redmine is a web-based project management tool. Where it lacks some of the enterprise features, it makes up for that with strong features such as a wiki, repository, and issue tracker.
5.ProjectLibre is an award winning tool, which has been downloaded over two million times in 200 countries. It holds features such as support for task management, resource allocation, tracking, Gantt charts, and much more.
6.LibrePlan is a web-based application, making project management available to not just the project manager, but the entire project team, and if necessary across organizations. This is another full featured tool supporting resource allocation, Gantt charts, financials, and more. 
7.With its feature set, OpenProject is designed to support your project teams throughout the whole project lifecycle and offers collaborative project planning, timeline reports, task management, time and cost reporting, Scrum, and much more.
8. Get free Jira, Confluence or any other software from Atlassian.
There are a couple of reasons. These tools are very popular among developers. If you want to bring new people to the community, you have to be sure, that they know the software they going to use. Every little hurdle, like forcing them to use something unpopular, can scare them off. Thanks to giving them a familiar environment, they have an easier job with helping to develop your code.
Atlassian tools were primarily designed for the developers, so you know, that they will fit perfectly for your Open Source project. Task management should be very intuitive in Jira. Confluence will allow you to keep all of the documentation in one place. Thanks to this, the community will be able to help you with completing it. Confluence will allow you also to create a wiki for your project.

Third, additional keep up with motivation spirit (can be collected by personas research, to understand users goals and pains):

•	Reward users – with regular monthly/weekly email newsletter where short survey can be done and Image with short story how Maps are used
•	Add more tasks options for users with experience 
•	Organize more local events and webinars

## Conclusion:

In order to implement the best working system, we need to create a survey and send it out to all users. However, not all of them are going to provide a feedback, but more likely people with a lot of experince and some issues/feedbacks would share it back (approximately 50%). Based on this, we can implement the suitable system (as yuo can see there is a big pool of choices) for community and improve wokload of Tech Support teamm that also integrates business requirements and the needs of the HOT tech team, HOT internal and HOT community. An intense research must be done in order to implement best working tools for community and HOT team for seamless collabartion.
